![](https://www.speedreadinglounge.com/wp-content/uploads/review-best-udemy-courses-768x351.jpg)

This project provides an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Udemy courses, utilizing various Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Plotly Express**. The analysis is conducted on the dataset containing Udemy course data, which includes insights into course categories, prices, reviews, and more.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the Udemy courses dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. Through this analysis, we aim to answer questions such as:
- Which categories have the most courses?
- What is the price distribution of Udemy courses?
- How are the courses rated based on student feedback?
